## How to use

To clone and run this application you will need Docker, Docker-Compose and Git to be installed on you computer.
Also there are a set of handy 'make' commands, which can help you to run app quicker. But the app can be started
without them as well.

From your command line:

```
- git clone https://github.com/stefanyuk/restaurant-application.git
- cd restaurant-application
```

If you want to generate test application data run the following:

```
- make run_app
- make generate_test_data

or without 'make' usage

- docker-compose up -d
- docker exec -it restaurant_app_backend_1 chmod +x data/populate_db_with_test_data.py && poetry run python data/populate_db_with_test_data.py
```

Now you can use application with admin permissions with the following credentials:
- email: admin@example.com (provide it as username to login)
- password: admin


Start application without test data with the following commands:

```
- docker-compose up -d
```

Now you can open the following url http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs to visit API docs generated by FastAPI.
Also, you can create basic user using the following endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/auth/signup
